1. **HierarchyNavigator**
   Display a nested [dict/addict/addict-tracking-changes](https://github.com/ofjustpy/addict-tracking-changes) dictionary as hierarchical navigation. Check out the demo/example code at [demo_hinav](demos/demo_hierarchy_navigation_using_italian_cuisine.py).

2. **EnumSelector**
   A simple component to display a Python enum type as a select HTML component.

3. **BiSplitView**
